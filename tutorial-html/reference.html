    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> Make sure to read this to get a basic understanding of the components of the cube.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2><u>Fixed Center Pieces</u></h2><p>No matter what kind of face rotation you do, the <b>center pieces</b> 
        always stay in the same position. They determine the color of each face.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2><u>Edges & Corners</u></h2>
        <p>Besides the center pieces, the cube is made up of 8 <b>corner pieces</b> (a piece with 3 stickers on it) and 12 <b>edge pieces</b> (2 stickers).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2><u>Notation</u></h2>
        <p>There are 6 total letters that define the cube in standard rubik's notation. These are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>F (Front)</b> - The face you are current looking at. All other faces are in reference to this face.</li>
            <li><b>R (Right)</b> - The face to the right hand side of the face you are currently looking at.</li>
            <li><b>L (Left)</b> - The face to the left hand side of the face you are currently looking at.</li>
            <li><b>U (Up)</b> - The face directly above the face you are currently looking at.</li>
            <li><b>D (Down)</b> - The face directly below the face you are currently looking at.</li>
            <li><b>B (Back)</b> - The face directly opposite of the face you are currently looking at.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A letter by itself indicates a <b>clockwise</b> rotation. A letter with an apostraphe <i>(F')</i> indicates
        a counter clockwise turn. Double rotations are notated with a 2 after the letter <i>(R2)</i>.</p>
    </li>
    
</ul>
