    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> Make sure to read this to get a basic understanding of the components of the cube.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2><u>3D View</u></h2>
            <p>Our 3D view is set up to show the Front, Right, and Upper faces. You are able to rotate the cube without changing what face you are focused on in the 2D view. See this diagram for clarification on the visible sides of the 3D cube:</p>

            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><u>2D View</u></h2>
            <p>The 2D view is where you will make your moves. You can click on any of the arrow buttons to perform that move. You can also switch what face is your "front" face by clicking any of the other faces.</p>

            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><u>Fixed Center Pieces</u></h2>
            <p>No matter what kind of face rotation you do, the <b>center pieces</b> always stay in the same position. They determine the color of each face.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><u>Edges & Corners</u></h2>
            <p>Besides the center pieces, the cube is made up of 8 <b>corner pieces</b> (a piece with 3 stickers on it) and 12 <b>edge pieces</b> (2 stickers).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2><u>Notation</u></h2>
            <p>There are 6 total letters that define the cube in standard rubik's notation. These are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>F (Front)</b> - The face you are current looking at. All other faces are in reference to this face.</li>
                <li><b>R (Right)</b> - The face to the right hand side of the face you are currently looking at.</li>
                <li><b>L (Left)</b> - The face to the left hand side of the face you are currently looking at.</li>
                <li><b>U (Up)</b> - The face directly above the face you are currently looking at.</li>
                <li><b>D (Down)</b> - The face directly below the face you are currently looking at.</li>
                <li><b>B (Back)</b> - The face directly opposite of the face you are currently looking at.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A letter by itself indicates a <b>clockwise</b> rotation. A letter with an apostraphe <i>(F')</i> indicates a counter clockwise turn. Double rotations are notated with a 2 after the letter <i>(R2)</i>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
