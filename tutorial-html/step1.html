<h1>Step 1: Choose a Starting Color</h1>
<p>Find the face that has a middle of the color you chose. Usually, you would chose the face that is closest 
  to being solved. For this example, thatâ€™ll be the red face. This is the face we will solve first.</p>
<p><i>Note: Keep in the mind, the centers never really change orientation. Even if you rotate the middle row,
  the orientation of the middles never change. Because of this quality of the cube, we can keep track of 
  the faces by their middle color (the red face will have a red middle square and it will always be surrounded 
  by green, white, blue, and yellow. It will also always be opposite of the orange face.</i></p>
